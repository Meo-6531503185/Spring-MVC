# Title: Choosing PostgreSQL as the Database Engine for Django Projects

# Context:
As we begin development on our Django project, we must make a crucial decision regarding the database engine to use.

# Decision:
After thorough consideration, we have opted to utilize PostgreSQL as the primary database engine for our Django project.

# Rationale:
PostgreSQL offers a robust feature set, including support for advanced data types, indexing, and transactions, aligning well with the demands of modern web applications. Its adherence to ACID principles ensures data integrity and reliability, crucial for our project's success. Furthermore, PostgreSQL's seamless integration with Django, extensive documentation, and vibrant community support make it an ideal choice for ensuring scalability, performance, and maintainability as our project evolves.

# Consequences

# Pros:

ACID compliance guarantees data integrity and reliability.
Rich feature set supports diverse application requirements.
Seamless integration with Django ensures compatibility and ease of development.
Extensive community support and documentation provide resources for troubleshooting and optimization.

# Cons:

Requires expertise in database administration for optimal performance tuning and maintenance.
Higher resource requirements compared to lighter database engines may necessitate additional infrastructure considerations.

# Sample Code:


from django.db import models

class Customer(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    email = models.EmailField(unique=True)
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)

    class Meta:
        indexes = [
            models.Index(fields=['name']),
            models.Index(fields=['created_at']),
        ]
