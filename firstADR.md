# Title: Selecting Django as the Web Framework

# Context:
Our company is embarking on the development of a new web application to streamline our internal processes and enhance customer experience. We need to choose a suitable web framework to kickstart this project.

# Decision:
After careful deliberation, we have decided to adopt Django as the web framework for our project.

# Rationale:
Django offers a comprehensive and feature-rich toolkit that aligns perfectly with our project requirements. Its built-in components such as ORM (Object-Relational Mapping), admin interface, and authentication system provide a solid foundation for rapid development. Additionally, Django's adherence to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle and its emphasis on clean and pragmatic design ensure maintainability and scalability as our project evolves. Its active community and extensive documentation further solidify Django as the optimal choice for our web development endeavors.

# Consequences

# Pros:

Rapid development facilitated by Django's built-in components and conventions.
Increased productivity due to Django's emphasis on DRY principle and clean design.
Enhanced maintainability and scalability as our project grows.
Access to a vibrant community and abundant resources for support and guidance.

# Cons:

Learning curve for team members unfamiliar with Django's conventions and paradigms.
Limited flexibility in certain customization scenarios where Django's conventions may conflict with project requirements.

# Sample Code:

# Sample Django view demonstrating simplicity and readability


from django.shortcuts import render
from .models import Product

def product_list(request):
    products = Product.objects.all()
    return render(request, 'products/product_list.html', {'products': products})
