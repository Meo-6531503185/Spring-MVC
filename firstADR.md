# Title: Selecting Django as the Web Framework

# Context:
Our company is embarking on the development of a new web application to streamline our internal processes and enhance customer experience. We need to choose a suitable web framework to kickstart this project.

# Decision:
After careful deliberation, we have decided to adopt Django as the web framework for our project.

# Rationale: Why do we choose this solution?
We choose Spring MVC for my web application because it offers a mature and well-supported framework with flexible configuration options and a clear separation of concerns through the MVC pattern. This makes our application maintainable, scalable, and secure, while also providing access to a wealth of resources and community support.

# Consequences

#Pros – What becomes easier?
It enables rapid and parallel development.
Development of the application becomes fast.
Easy for multiple developers to work together.
Easier to Update the application.
It is Easier to Debug because we have multiple levels in the application.

#Cons – What becomes more difficult?
Spring MVC has high complexity to develop the applications using this pattern.

# Sample Code:

# Sample Django view demonstrating simplicity and readability


from django.shortcuts import render
from .models import Product

def product_list(request):
    products = Product.objects.all()
    return render(request, 'products/product_list.html', {'products': products})
